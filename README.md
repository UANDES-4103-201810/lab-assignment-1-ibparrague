Base project for lab assignment 1
2.-Done

3.- The page structure has a head with a couple of link, and a body witch contains a center and a scipt.
This center contains a table, that has a tbody, witch has the information of the format of the page on a list from top to bottom.
Inside this tbody, we can see three "tr" (table row), the first one is the "Hacker news" orange (#ff6600) header, and a table that has the links of the page (new | comments.. etc).
The second "tr" of the main tbody has all the links of the forum in a itemlist, each line of text displayed on the page has is distributed in three parts, the number next to the link, the arrow to vote next to the link, and the title with a reference link.
The third "tr" of the main tbody is the bottom of the page, that has a couple of links, and a search bar.

4.-The news.ycombinator tab has six files in total.
The first one is the "(index)" of the page, witch has some variables and resurces of the web page, including the score of the links, the user that upload them, etc.
The second one stores the functions or scripts of the page. It basically allows the user to interact with the page.
The third one contains the style resources for the page.
And finally the fourth, fifth and sixth contains images that are used throughout the page.

5.- From what i could gather, an xhr request can fetch the data at one of two moments, either asynchronously or synchronously.
If the process is loaded synchronously, it has to load the whole page before displaying it, and if the process is done asynchronously,
the user can still use the page without being interrupted while the files load.
Note: in this case Hacker News did not download any XHR files, therefore it didn't took any time to load them.

6.- The connection to the website was done by COMODO RSA Domain Validation Secure Server CA.
And the  expiration date is "21-08-2019" (DD-MM-YYYY)
